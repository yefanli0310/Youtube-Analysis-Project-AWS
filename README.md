# Youtube-Analysis-Project-On-AWS
## Overview:
This project aims to securely manage, streamline, and perform analysis on the structured and semi-structured YouTube videos data based on the video categories and the trending metrics.

## Dataset
YouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine, “To determine the year’s top-trending videos, YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”), celebrity and/or reality TV performances, and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for. \

## Goal
1. Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
2. ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
3. Data lake — We will be getting data from multiple sources so we need centralized repo to store them
4. Scalability — As the size of our data increases, we need to make sure our system scales with it
5. Cloud — We can’t process vast amounts of data on our local computer so we need to use the cloud, in this case, we will use AWS
6. Reporting — Build a dashboard to get answers to the question we asked earlier
## AWS Services I will Using in this Project
1. Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2. AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
3. QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
4. AWS Glue: A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
5. AWS Lambda: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
6. AWS Athena: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
